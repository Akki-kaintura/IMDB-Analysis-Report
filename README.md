Furthermore, it will analyze the sensitivity of audience preferences to movie duration, pinpointing ideal lengths for maximizing viewer engagement. This comprehensive approach combines economic insights, regional nuances, decade-specific trends, and duration sensitivity to provide a holistic understanding of global cinematic preferences, aiding filmmakers, studios, and industry stakeholders in strategic decision-making.
